Back from Holiday on 7.1.22
Looked at Long call data and 2012-2015 is the time period where we can analyse spatial dist. of calls given
Methods are to use use-availability framework (like an RSF) and use AKDEs of other individuals as prob. of encounter - 
occurrance dist. for unflanged?

Need to revise some of the geo methods - there is an issue with saving pts. in the specified CRS. Don't really know what went wrong...

To do:
Keep working on LC project - run akdes for 2012-2015, rasterize them, and create polygons of akdes for each focal individual to specifiy where "available" pts can fall
reread the wilmers puma communication paper b/c similar methods...
Fix georeferncing prob

read baboon pred paper (second-author on this)
work w/copy editor at Mam Rev. and notify Panthera PR when paper should be coming out...
start writing methods for LC paper
set up meeting time with Meg to discuss questions for georeferencing project
