-Working on long-calling project and still trying to create AKDEs  
for each individual per year. We may run into issues with not having  
enough GPS data on individuals while still having many LCs.  

New steps for creating AKDEs:
-load ctmmweb and use the shiny application to subset the raw data by  year.
-then create telemetry object, run movement models, and select best  by AICc
- then create AKDEs.
-create CDEs between males and other individuals
(each male to each other male and female)
-plot occurrance of LCs
-rasterize CDEs to see if they mainly occurr in areas of high  
encounter probability
