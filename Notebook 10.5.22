Added coordinates to long call heard data 
This was done by matching observations with the nearest timestamp
The dataset contains many missing locations but this is correct because some periods are truly missing from the GPS data
Additionally several individuals within the LCH dataset are not followed e.g. unknowns, so these also are misssing coordinates

# all these observations together could go into spatial model of where they respond
# Follow data can be used for whether the distance and whether individuals are in affects
# using PAM system, look at the latency to respond using survival model
# using long calls from PAM system match to when individuals were followed from long call heard
# to get distance and to get individual who called

# get dates into matching format so coordinates can be matched
